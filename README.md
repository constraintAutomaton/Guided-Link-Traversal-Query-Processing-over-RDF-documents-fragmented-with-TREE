# Exploring a rule-based approach for source selection in link traversal queries

## Building a PDF
The authors compiled the PDF version using `pdflatex` (you can use your favorite latex compiler).
We created a `makefile` to facilitate the building of the PDF version.
One can simply execute `make main.pdf` or `make` to produce the PDF version if `pdflatex` and the other dependencies of the [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) suite are installed on the machine of the user.
