Our key contributions are (i) a complete complexity analysis for all operator fragments of the SPARQL query language, which -- as a central result -- shows that the SPARQL operator Optional alone is responsible for the PSpace-completeness of the evaluation problem, (ii) a study of equivalences over SPARQL algebra, including both rewriting rules like filter and projection pushing that are well-known from relational algebra optimization as well as SPARQL-specific rewriting schemes, and (iii) an approach to the semantic optimization of SPARQL queries, built on top of the classical chase algorithm. While studied in the context of a theoretically motivated set semantics, almost all results carry over to the official, bag-based semantics and therefore are of immediate practical relevance.},

  abstract   = {SPARQL is the standard language for querying RDF data. In this article, we address systematically the formal study of the database aspects of SPARQL, concentrating in its graph pattern matching facility. We provide a compositional semantics for the core part of SPARQL, and study the complexity of the evaluation of several fragments of the language. Among other complexity results, we show that the evaluation of general SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete. We identify a large class of SPARQL patterns, defined by imposing a simple and natural syntactic restriction, where the query evaluation problem can be solved more efficiently. This restriction gives rise to the class of well-designed patterns. We show that the evaluation problem is coNP-complete for well-designed patterns. Moreover, we provide several rewriting rules for well-designed patterns whose application may have a considerable impact in the cost of evaluating SPARQL queries.},

  abstract   = {When benchmarking rdf data management systems such as public transport route planners, system evaluation needs to happen under various realistic circumstances, which requires a wide range of datasets with different properties. Real-world datasets are almost ideal, as they offer these realistic circumstances, but they are often hard to obtain and inflexible for testing. For these reasons, synthetic dataset generators are typically preferred over real-world datasets due to their intrinsic flexibility. Unfortunately, many synthetic dataset that are generated within benchmarks are insufficiently realistic, raising questions about the generalizability of benchmark results to real-world scenarios. In order to benchmark geospatial and temporal rdf data management systems such as route planners with sufficient external validity and depth, we designed p od igg , a highly configurable generation algorithm for synthetic public transport datasets with realistic geospatial and temporal characteristics comparable to those of their real-world variants. The algorithm is inspired by real-world public transit network design and scheduling methodologies. This article discusses the design and implementation of p od igg and validates the properties of its generated datasets. Our findings show that the generator achieves a sufficient level of realism, based on the existing coherence metric and new metrics we introduce specifically for the public transport domain. Thereby, p od igg provides a flexible foundation for benchmarking rdf data management systems with geospatial and temporal data.},

  abstract   = {The traversal-based approach to execute queries over Linked Data on the WWW fetches data by traversing data links and, thus, is able to make use of up-to-date data from initially unknown data sources. While the downside of this approach is the delay before the query engine completes a query execution, user perceived response time may be improved significantly by returning as many elements of the result set as soon as possible. To this end, the query engine requires a traversal strategy that enables the engine to fetch result-relevant data as early as possible. The challenge for such a strategy is that the query engine does not know a priori which of the data sources discovered during the query execution will contain result-relevant data. In this paper, we investigate 14 different approaches to rank traversal steps and achieve a variety of traversal strategies. We experimentally study their impact on response times and compare them to a baseline that resembles a breadth-first traversal. While our experiments show that some of the approaches can achieve noteworthy improvements over the baseline in a significant number of cases, we also observe that for every approach, there is a non-negligible chance to achieve response times that are worse than the baseline.},

  abstract   = {We present Dedalo, a framework which is able to exploit Linked Data to generate explanations for clusters. In general, any result of a Knowledge Discovery process, including clusters, is interpreted by human experts who use their background knowledge to explain them. However, for someone without such expert knowledge, those results may be difficult to understand. Obtaining a complete and satisfactory explanation becomes a laborious and time-consuming process, involving expertise in possibly different domains. Having said so, not only does the Web of Data contain vast amounts of such background knowledge, but it also natively connects those domains. While the efforts put in the interpretation process can be reduced with the support of Linked Data, how to automatically access the right piece of knowledge in such a big space remains an issue. Dedalo is a framework that dynamically traverses Linked Data to find commonalities that form explanations for items of a cluster. We have developed different strategies (or heuristics) to guide this traversal, reducing the time to get the best explanation. In our experiments, we compare those strategies and demonstrate that Dedalo finds relevant and sophisticated Linked Data explanations from different areas.},

  abstract   = {Query execution over the Web of Linked Data has attracted much attention recently. A particularly interesting approach is link traversal based query execution which proposes to integrate the traversal of data links into the creation of query results. Hence -in contrast to traditional query execution paradigms- this does not assume a fixed set of relevant data sources beforehand; instead, the traversal process discovers data and data sources on the fly and, thus, enables applications to tap the full potential of the Web.While several authors have studied possibilities to implement the idea of link traversal based query execution and to optimize query execution in this context, no work exists that discusses theoretical foundations of the approach in general. Our paper fills this gap.We introduce a well-defined semantics for queries that may be executed using a link traversal based approach. Based on this semantics we formally analyze properties of such queries. In particular, we study the computability of queries as well as the implications of querying a potentially infinite Web of Linked Data. Our results show that query computation in general is not guaranteed to terminate and that for any given query it is undecidable whether the execution terminates. Furthermore, we define an abstract execution model that captures the integration of link traversal into the query execution process. Based on this model we prove the soundness and completeness of link traversal based query execution and analyze an existing implementation approach.},

  abstract  = {Public transit operators often publish their open data as a single data dump, but developers with limited computational resources may not be able to process all this data. Existing work has already focused on fragmenting the data by departure time, so that data consumers can be more selective in the data they process. However, each fragment still contains data from the entire operator's service area. We build upon this idea by fragmenting geospatially as well as by departure time. Our method is robust to changes in the original data, such as the deletion or the addition of stops, which is crucial in scenarios where data publishers do not control the data itself. In this paper we explore popular clustering methods such as k-means and METIS, alongside two simple domain-specific methods of our own. We compare the effectiveness of each for the use case of client-side route planning, focusing on the ease of use of the data and the cacheability of the data fragments. Our results show that simply clustering stops by their proximity to 8 transport hubs yields the most promising results: queries are 2.4 times faster and download 4 times less data. More than anything though, our results show that the difference between clustering methods is small, and that engineers can safely choose practical and simple solutions. We expect that this insight also holds true for publishing other geospatial data such as road networks, sensor data, or points of interest.},

  abstract  = {There is an abundance of services and applications that find the most efficient route between two places, people are not always interested in efficiency; sometimes we just want a pleasant route. Such routes are subjective though, and may depend on contextual factors that route planners are oblivious to. One possible solution is to automatically learn what a user wants, but this requires behavioral data, leading to a cold start problem. An alternative approach is to let the user express their desires explicitly, effectively helping them create the most pleasant route themselves. In this paper we provide a proof of concept of a client-side route planner that does exactly that. We aggregated the Point of Interest information from OpenStreetMap into Regions of Interest, and published the results on the Web. These regions are described semantically, enabling the route planner to align the user's input to what is known about their environment. Planning a 3 km long pedestrian route through a city center takes 5 s, but subsequent adjustments to the route require less than a second to compute. These execution times imply that our approach is feasible, although further optimizations are needed to bring this to the general public.},

LODStats consists of two parts: the core collects statistics about the LOD cloud and publishes it on the LODStats web portal, a front-end for exploration of dataset statistics. Statistics are published both in human-readable and machine-readable formats, thus allowing consumption of the data through web front-end by the users as well as through an API by services and applications. As an example for the latter we showcase how to visualize the statistical data with the CubeViz application.},
