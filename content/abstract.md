## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Semantically fragmented linked data is a useful method for storing graph-type information, such as bus routes and city plans, as well as data events streams like sensors outputs. Link traversal querying is the most effective way to search the entire collection, since each fragment refers to another and theyâ€™re is not necessarily a summary document of the fragmentation.
<!-- Need         -->
However, querying using link traversal can be inefficient due to the number of resources that must be fetched to answer a query, and because of a lack of effective query planning. But by combining semantic links with SPARQL filters, we can reduce the number of nodes that need to be visited, since fragment that doesn't meet the filter conditions will be skipped because we are certain that the requested triple don't reside inside the document.
<!-- Task         -->
To improve the speed of querying these documents, and to test the hypothesis that pushing the SPARQL filter expression down to a link traversal discriminator can reduce the execution time, we developed a boolean expression solver. This solver evaluates the feasibility of combining the filter expression with the semantic links between the fragments. As  a form of fragmented linked data, we used the [TREE specification](https://treecg.github.io/specification/), which fragments data semantically using a set of triples called [relations](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#relation).
