## Conclusion
{:#conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a GLTQP approach to 
discriminate the data sources of fragmented RDF documents following the TREE specification. 
We showed that we can exploit the structural properties of the TREE specification 
and the constraint of the link between the fragment to reduce the search domain
that a query engine has to explore.

This work opens the possibility for faster query of fragmented RDF documents, 
given that the data provider use hypermedia description to characterize the fragmentation
in a structure manner. 
It comes then that our work is a motivation for more structure fragmented RDF documents
and for the implementation of those a priori knowledge inside RDF query engine.
