Most research around LTQP centered around query execution in Linked Open Data environments.
Given the pseudo-infinite number of documents on the Web, traversing over all documents is practically infeasible.
To define completeness, different reachability criteria~\cite{hartig2012} were introduced to allow the discrimination of links.
Recently, an alternative direction was introduced where the query engine uses the structure from the data publisher to guide itself towards relevant data sources~\cite{taelman2023, verborgh2020}.

We define our approach as a rule-based reachability criterion.
Our approach builds upon the concept of guided link traversal, and structural assumptions~\cite{taelman2023} to exploit the structural properties of TREE datasets to prune irrelevant links.
Concretely, we interpret the hypermedia descriptions of constraints in TREE fragments as boolean equations.
Upon discovery of a document, the query engine gathers the relevant triples to form the boolean expression of the constraint on the data of the next fragment.
After the parsing of the expression, the filter expression of the SPARQL query is pushdown into the engine's source selection component.
Lastly, the two boolean expressions are evaluated to determine if they can be satisfied, upon satisfaction the IRI targeting the next fragment is added to the link queue otherwise the IRI is pruned.


\subsection{Experimental results}

We implemented our approach using the LTQP version of the query engine Comunica~\cite{comunica}.
To evaluate it, we executed four queries similar to the one in Figure \ref{lst:system}~\sepfootnote{sf:opensSource}.
They were executed over the DAHCC participant 31 dataset (487 MB) with a timeout of two minutes.
We fragmented the dataset following the TREE specification with a tree topology with 100 and 1000 nodes ($n$).

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{n} & \textbf{Query} & \textbf{Time-predicate (ms)}  & \textbf{Time-rule (ms)} & \textbf{Req-rule} & \textbf{Res-rule} \\
        \hline
        100 & Q1 & x & 8,892& 3 & 0 \\
        100 & Q2 & x & 3,541& 3 & 1 \\
        100 & Q3 & x & 59,274& 8 & 8,166 \\

        1000 & Q1 & x & 1,171& 3 & 0 \\
        1000 & Q2 & x & 734& 3 & 1 \\
        1000 & Q3 & x & 39,987& 51 & 8,166 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{
    The predicate-based reachability criterion is not able to execute the queries. 
    The rule-based criterion performs better with a larger number of fragments.
    X means that the query did not finish before the timeout.
    Q4 is not depicted because they were not able to terminate before the timeout.}
    \label{tab:result}
\end{table}

The queries were executed using two configurations.
In the first configuration, we use a predicate-based reachability criterion where the engine follows each link of the fragmented dataset.
For the second one, we use our rule-based reachability criterion approach.
As shown in Table \ref{tab:result} no queries could be answered within the timeout by following every fragment.
A possible explanation is the high number of HTTP requests performed~\cite{Hartig2016} leading to non-relevant data sources to answer the queries.
With our rule-based reachability criterion, we see that the queries performed over the 1000 nodes fragmentation perform better than the ones with 100 nodes, particularly when the query has one or zero results.
In those cases, the query execution time is almost one order of magnitude lower compared to the one with 100 nodes.
With Q3 we see that the percentage of reduction is 32\%, this lowering of performance might be caused by the increase by a factor of 17 in HTTP requests.
This raises an interesting observation because we do not observe a reduction of execution time proportional to the reduction of HTTP requests.
Previous research has proposed that inefficient query plan might be the bottleneck of some queries in structured environments~\cite{taelman2023,eschauzier_quweda_2023}.
However, our results seems to show that the size of the internal data source might have a bigger impact on performance than noted in previous studies.
The query Q4 was not able to be answered, with any setup, because the query requires a larger number of fragments to be processed.
