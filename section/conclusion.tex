\section{Conclusion}

Our preliminary results show that our rule-based reachability criterion can significantly reduce the query execution time.\rt{Compared to?}
This work opens the possibility for faster and more versatile traversal-based query execution over fragmented RDF documents by using hypermedia descriptions to declare logical expressions.\rt{But what is the benefit? Make sure to emphasize why putting everything in for example a SPARQL endpoint may not be sustainable.}
Our experiment also highlights that the size of the internal data store might have more impact on performance than noted in previous studies.
In future work, we will perform more exhaustive evaluations over other types of domain-oriented fragmentation strategies and combinations thereof;
and investigate how to generalize our approach to support more expressive online reasoning for source selection during traversal queries.
