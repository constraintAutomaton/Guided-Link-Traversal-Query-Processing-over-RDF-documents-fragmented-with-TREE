\section{Conclusion}

Our preliminary results show that our rule-based reachability criterion can significantly reduce the query execution time.
This work opens the possibility for faster and more versatile traversal-based query execution over fragmented RDF documents by using hypermedia descriptions to declare logical expressions.
In future work, we will investigate how to generalize our approach for more general online reasoning and adaptivity between multiple environments with their own way of declaring logical expressions.
