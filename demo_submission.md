Our demonstration consists of showing the performance of our reachability criteria for querying [TREE document](https://treecg.github.io/specification/). This can be divided into two categories: first showing how the criteria diminishes the number of HTTP requests necessary to answer a query without diminishing the completeness of the result and second showing the reduction of the query execution time. More concretely we will use the Link Traversal Query Processing version of a modulable SPARQL query engine called [Comunica](https://github.com/comunica/comunica-feature-link-traversal) to make simple query with a gradation in complexity of the SPARQL FILTER expression. We will use three reachability criteria for our demonstration, $c_{all}$ which consist in dereferencing all the links of an RDF document, it is the most naive approach, $c_{tree}$ which consist in following only the link that lead to other fragments and finally $c_{treer}$ which consist in following only the relation that has a boolean expression solvable with the SPARQL query expression. For the demonstration we will use a dataset produced by a [time series library](https://github.com/TREEcg/LDES-timeseries) as for the query engine, we will use a combination of our [demo engine](https://comunica.dev/research/link_traversal/) and [our implementation of $c_{treer}$](https://github.com/constraintAutomaton/comunica-feature-link-traversal/tree/feature/time-filtering-tree-sparqlee-implementation).
